              Existing research approaches offer the participant limited help in understanding how to
              cope effectively with such interactions. To gain a deeper understanding of how to be
              effective in such a partially competitive and partially cooperative environment, a computer
              tournament was conducted for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Decision rules were
              submitted by entrants who were recruited primarily from experts in game theory from
              a variety of disciplines: psychology, political science, economics, sociology, and mathema-
              tics. The results of the tournament demonstrate that there are subtle reasons for an in-
              dividualistic pragmatist to cooperate as long as the other side does, to be somewhat for-
              giving, and to be optimistic about the other side's responsiveness.},

  abstract = {This study reports and analyzes the results of the second round of the computer tour-
              nament for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The object is to gain a deeper understanding
              of how to perform well in such a setting. The 62 entrants were able to draw lessons from the
              results of the first round and were able to design their entries to take these lessons into
              account. The results of the second round demonstrate a number of subtle pitfalls which
              specific types of decision rules can encounter. The winning rule was once again TIT FOR
              TAT, the rule which cooperates on the first move and then does what the other player did
              on the previous move. The analysis of the results shows the value of not being the first to
              defect, of being somewhat forgiving, but also the importance of being provocable. An
              analysis of hypothetical alternative tournaments demonstrates the robustness of the re-
              sults.},

  abstract =     {Imaging of objects under variable lighting
                  directions is an important and frequent practice in
                  computer vision, machine vision, and image-based
                  rendering. Methods for such imaging have
                  traditionally used only a single light source per
                  acquired image. They may result in images that are
                  too dark and noisy, e.g., due to the need to avoid
                  saturation of highlights. We introduce an approach
                  that can significantly improve the quality of such
                  images, in which multiple light sources illuminate
                  the object simultaneously from different
                  directions. These illumination-multiplexed frames
                  are then computationally demultiplexed. The approach
                  is useful for imaging dim objects, as well as
                  objects having a specular reflection component. We
                  give the optimal scheme by which lighting should be
                  multiplexed to obtain the highest quality output,
                  for signal-independent noise. The scheme is based on
                  Hadamard codes. The consequences of imperfections
                  such as stray light, saturation, and noisy
                  illumination sources are then studied. In addition,
                  the paper analyzes the implications of shot noise,
                  which is signal-dependent, to Hadamard
                  multiplexing. The approach facilitates practical
                  lighting setups having high directional
                  resolution. This is shown by a setup we devise,
                  which is flexible, scalable, and programmable. We
                  used it to demonstrate the benefit of multiplexing
                  in experiments.},

  abstract =     {We consider the problem of shape recovery for real
                  world scenes, where a variety of global illumination
                  (inter-reflections, subsurface scattering, etc.) and
                  illumination defocus effects are present. These
                  effects introduce systematic and often significant
                  errors in the recovered shape. We introduce a
                  structured light technique called Micro Phase
                  Shifting, which overcomes these problems. The key
                  idea is to project sinusoidal patterns with
                  frequencies limited to a narrow, high-frequency
                  band. These patterns produce a set of images over
                  which global illumination and defocus effects remain
                  constant for each point in the scene. This enables
                  high quality reconstructions of scenes which have
                  traditionally been considered hard, using only a
                  small number of images. We also derive theoretical
                  lower bounds on the number of input images needed
                  for phase shifting and show that Micro PS achieves
                  the bound.},
